Suppose that some individuals have unobserved characteristics (ability) that enable them to get higher earnings. If these individuals also have above-average schooling levels, this implies a positive correlation between schooling and error term and an OLS estimator that is upward biased. Another reason for endogeneity is the existence of measurement error in the schooling measure which leads to downward bias in the OLS estimator. Therefore, we decide to implement IV estimation to alleviate the potential bias."

The standard error of educ in the IV model is way higher than in the OLS model, and the coefficient is not statistically significant with p-value > 0.05. If we consider the given coefficient despite its' probability to be null, the OLS regression is downwardly biased, as the IV model suggests a higher coefficient. Otherwise, we can consider the coefficient to be 0 and the OLS regression to be upwardly biased. The IV model has higher standard error because the IV method accounts for endogeneity by using instruments to predict the endogenous variable, which introduces additional variability. This additional uncertainty about the instrument's validity and its correlation with the endogenous variable makes the IV estimates less precise than OLS estimates. The large value also suggest that the instrument is weak.",
